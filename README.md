# projetnode
Node js project (Estelle Drancy, Sarah Kardache)

- to launch :
npm install 
npm run build 
npm run populate 
npm start 

- It is only possible to login with the two users implemented in the database, 
the button Bring the metrics doesn't work but all the functions have been implemented. 

- There is a problem with the post functions and the connections with href references in .ejs files but we haven't been able to detect the errors.
